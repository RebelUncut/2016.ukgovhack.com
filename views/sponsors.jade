			p As part of UKGovHack we want to trial a new approach to event sponsorship. Instead of traditional sponsorship tiers, we are inviting both individuals and organisations to contribute an amount that feels achievable for them. We will openly publish details of all our supporters here on our website. Any excess will seed future for good community projects run by Rebel Labs.

			p There are two ways you can contribute to UKGovHack - as a supporter, or as a sponsor.

				h2 Supporters
				p Supporters are members of the community who want to support this event. We will be thankful for anything we receive, and all supporters will get their names on the event t-shirts, on the website, and a shoutout in the finale.

				h2 Sponsors
				p Sponsors are for organisations of all kinds and sizes. Every sponsor will be treated the same, receiving their logo on the t-shirt, on the website, a shoutout in the finale, and a visible roller banner in the venue if you can provide one.
